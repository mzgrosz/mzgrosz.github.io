## Working Papers

### The Returns to a Large Community College Program: Evidence from Admissions Lotteries 

(Revisions requested at *American Economic Journal: Economic Policy*) 

*Abstract*: Community colleges are an important postsecondary sector, yet there are few causal estimates of their effect on student earnings. I estimate the labor market returns to a particularly important degree, the Associate’s Degree in Nursing, by leveraging random variation from admissions lotteries. I use student-level academic and earnings records across two decades for community college students in California. I find that enrolling in the program increases earnings by 55 percent. I also document substantial heterogeneity in these effects across nursing programs. I estimate that the benefits of expanding a program far outweigh the costs and are close to revenue neutral.

### In-State Tuition Policies and the College Decisions of Undocumented Students: Evidence from Colorado

with Annie Hines 

(Under review)

*Abstract*: This paper evaluates the effects of a tuition policy change on the college application and enrollment behavior of undergraduate students. We use student-level data for all Colorado public post-secondary institutions to analyze the effects of a 2013 law that granted in-state tuition to certain undocumented immigrant students. We find evidence of an increase in the enrollment of likely undocumented students, as well as an increase in the number of credit hours for these students. Leveraging application-level data, we show that the policy induced more undocumented students to enroll in college, but we ascribe this increase to an increase in applications rather than a change in the acceptance or enrollment rate. We do not find evidence of policy-induced changes in the persistence, full-time status or completed credit hours of continuing students.

### Selection into Identification in Fixed Effects Models, with Application to Head Start 

with Doug Miller and Na'ama Shenhav 

(Under review)

*Abstract*: Many papers use fixed effects (FE) to identify causal impacts of an intervention. A leading example of this is family fixed effects (FFE), which compares the outcomes of siblings with different exposure to treatment. In this paper we show that when the treatment is binary, this design induces non-random selection of families into the identifying sample, which we term selection into identification. We document across multiple settings that this causes the identifying sample to be overly representative of larger families and that, in the presence of heterogeneous treatment effects, the estimated effect is biased relative to the average marginal treatment effect (ATE) for siblings. Additionally, we prove that for binary outcomes the linear probability model is unbiased, and provide a novel method for recovering ATEs from conditional logit specifications. We apply these insights to examine the long-term effects of Head Start in the PSID utilizing an expanded dataset of outcomes up to age 40 to update Garces, Thomas, and Currie (2002). Using FFE, we find that participation in Head Start increases the likelihood of completing some college by 12 percentage points. We estimate this parameter to be 50% larger than the ATE for siblings. We find no evidence of strong positive effects of Head Start on overall economic or physical well-being. We conclude that alternative research design strategies should be pursued to gain representative evidence about the long term impact of Head Start.

### Do Postsecondary Training Programs Respond to the Labor Market?

*Abstract*: This paper analyzes whether postsecondary training programs have kept up with shifts in the occupational structure of the 
labor market over the past decades. I show long-term trends in the distribution of degrees and certificates across occupation groupings in the nation’s largest community college system. Using an instrumental variables approach I then estimate that an occupation’s share of community college completions grows 0.47 percentage points for very percentage point increase in its share of employment. However, I show that this relationship is primarily due to increases in student demand rather than to colleges expanding capacity.

### Capacity and Flexibility in CTE Programs: Program Offerings and Student Success

with Michal Kurlaender and Ann Stevens

### Majority Builds: Direct Democracy and the Allocation of School Facilities Spending, 

with Ross Milton

*Abstract*: The need to put local budgeting questions to a referendum vote is generally thought to reduce spending, but little is known about whether this comes from bureaucrats changing their behavior or voters rejecting their proposals. We leverage a policy change in California that lowered the share of votes required to pass a school capital improvement bond. We show that this loosening of the constraint on districts lowered the average vote share for school bonds by 3 percentage points. We find that part of the explanation for this effect comes from school districts increasing the amount of proposed per-pupil spending and thus lowering their support, especially for bonds closest to the old threshold. We also use detailed information on school construction projects to show how intra-district spending changed in response to the lowered vote threshold.
