	<p>Welcome! I am an Economist at the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
	<p>In my research I study the connection between education and the labor market. I'm especially interested in community colleges, career-technical education, and postsecondary education policy in general. Any opinions on this website are mine alone and do not represent those of the Federal Trade Commission or its Commissioners. </p>
